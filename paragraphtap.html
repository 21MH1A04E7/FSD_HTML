    <p> 1<sup>st </sup>The <b>Constitution of India</b> is the <em>supreme law</em> of India.[2][3] The document lays down the framework that demarcates fundamental political code, structure,
         procedures, powers, and duties of <mark> government</mark> institutions and sets out fundamental rights, directive principles, and the duties of citizens. It is the 
         longest written <u>national</u> constitution in the world.[4][5][6]<br><br>
        It imparts constitutional <i>supremacy </i>(not <del>parliamentary</del> supremacy, since it was created by a constituent assembly rather than Parliament) and was adopted
         by its people with a declaration in its preamble.[7] Parliament cannot override the constitution.<br><br>

        It was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India on 26 November 1949 and became effective on 26 January 1950.[8] The constitution replaced the
         Government of India Act 1935 as the country's fundamental governing document, and the Dominion of India became the Republic of India. To ensure 
         constitutional autochthony, its framers repealed prior acts of the British parliament in Article 395.[9] India celebrates its constitution on 26
          January as Republic Day.[10]<br><br>
        The constitution <small>declares</small> India a <big>sovereign</big>, socialist, secular,[11] and democratic republic, assures its citizens justice, equality, and liberty,
         and endeavours to promote fraternity.[12] The original 1950 constitution is preserved in a nitrogen-filled case at the Parliament House in New Delhi.[13]
